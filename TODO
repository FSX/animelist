TODO for AnimeList

 X Search system (dialog, search result parsing, etc.).
   - Add anime via search dialog.
 - lists.py
   - Actions for "Details" item in the popup menu.
 - Media player detection (for Mplayer etc.) (+GUI).
 - Proper error handling.
 - Make it work on Windows. The usage of threads is probably preventing
   it to work correctly on Windows.
 - Clean up code.

Maybe:
 - Support for manga list. I don't use MAL for keeping track of manga so
   I'm not sure if this feature is going to be implemented. It shouldn't
   be too hard to do though.

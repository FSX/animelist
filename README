=== Introduction ===

AnimeList is still under development and not everything works yet and stuff can be bugged.
Only tested on Linux (Arch linux) and Windows. It has not been test on any other
opererating systems.

Before you can use AnimeList you jave to install GTK[1], Python[2], PyGTK[3], PyCairo[3], PyGObject[3].
For Python and PyGTK are Windows installers available. A Windows installer for GTK
can be found at gtk-win.sourceforge.net[4].

To startup AnimeList you need 'cd' to the AnimeList directory and make "animelist.py" executable
(if needed) and do "./animelist.py". A dialog will popup and ask about your login details.
After you've done that it will load your list.

Send a PM to "http://myanimelist.net/profile/FSX" if you have questions.

=== Features ===

 * Manage your anime list from MyAnimeList.net.
 * The GUI does not freeze when adjustments are made to your list.
 * Search anime and add them via the search section.
 * Show details (more information) of anime.
 * Works on Linux, Windows and maybe Mac OS X (not tested).
 * Login details are encoded before they're saved (your username and password
   are not saved as plain text).

=== Development ===

The source code can be at Bitbucket[5] and planned features in the TODO file.
Any help with testing, especially on other OS than Windows, is really appreciated.

Notes:

 - The *.ui files in the 'ui' directory are used to build the GUIs of certain
   dialogs/windows with gtk.Builder. The *.glade files are used to design the GUI
   with Glade or Gazpacho.

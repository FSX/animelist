AnimeList is still under development and not everything works yet and stuff can be bugged.
Only tested on Linux (Arch linux) and Windows XP Home. It has not been test on any other
opererating systems.

Before you can use AnimeList you jave to install GTK[1], Python[2], PyGTK[3], PyCairo[3], PyGObject[3].
For Python and PyGTK are Windows installers available. A Windows installer for GTK
can be found at gtk-win.sourceforge.net[4].

To startup AnimeList you need 'cd' to the AnimeList directory and make "animelist.py" executable
(if needed) and do "./animelist.py". A dialog will popup and ask about your login details.
After you've done that it will load your list.

Send a PM to "http://myanimelist.net/profile/FSX" if you have questions.

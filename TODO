TODO for AnimeList

 - Preferences (dialog).
   - Should be saved in a secure file/format, because the username
     and password are saved in the preferences file.
 - About dialog.
 - Search system (dialog, search result parsing, etc.).
   - Add anime via search dialog.
 - Save tasks when they could not be executed at shutdown.
 - Execute tasks at shutdown or startup.
 - lists.py
   - Actions for "Details" and "Delete" items in the popup menu.
 - Media player detection (for Mplayer etc.) (+GUI).
 - Proper error handling.
 - Make it work on Windows. The usage of threads is probably preventing
   it to work correctly on Windows.
 - Clean up code.

TODO for AnimeList

- = Still have to be done.
* = Done.
~ = In process.

 ~ Code cleanup and add doc strings!

 - Only refresh list when user details are changed.

 ~ Details dialog:
   A details dialog for anime that appears after a user has double clicked on
   a row in one of the lists (anime and search section.

 - Verify user details:
   Verify the user details one they're entered in the preferences dialog.
   If they're not valid: block the access to the application (or it's functions).

 - Save window size on exit:
   Save these to the settings file on exit and apply them to the window on
   startup (and maybe save the position too?).

 - Proper sorting in lists:
   Currently this work really good. Sorting by episode doesn't work and scores
   aren't sorted properly.

 - Modularize sections:
   So section can be plugged in without having to modify any other files.

 - Preferences dialog:
   Make an API for the preferences dialog so it's easy to extend.

 - Manga section:
   Will be done when the Unofficial API has support for manga.

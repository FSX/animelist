TODO for AnimeList

- = Still have to be done.
* = Done.
~ = In process.

=== Version 0.1 ===

 * Details dialog:
   A details dialog for anime that appears after a user has double clicked on
   a row in one of the lists (anime and search section).

 ~ Code cleanup and add doc strings!

 * Only refresh list when user details are changed.

 - Verify user details:
   Verify the user details one they're entered in the preferences dialog.
   If they're not valid: block the access to the application (or it's functions).

 - Save window size on exit:
   Save these to the settings file on exit and apply them to the window on
   startup (and maybe save the position too?).

 ~ Proper sorting in lists:
   Currently this work really good. Sorting by episode doesn't work and scores
   aren't sorted properly.

 - Manual:
   A manual with images that explains how to do certain tasks in the application.


=== Version 0.2 ===

 - Modularize sections (plugin system):
   So section can be plugged in without having to modify any other files.

 - Preferences dialog:
   Make an API for the preferences dialog so it's easy to extend.

 - Media player detection
   Detect a mediaplayer playing a file that's in your list and update it.

 - Torrent section:
   Read RSS feeds from certain websites and show the items that are in the users' list.


=== Unplanned ===

 - Manga section:
   Will be done when the Unofficial API has support for manga.

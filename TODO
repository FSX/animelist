TODO for AnimeList

- = Still have to be done.
* = In process.

 * Search section:
   - Select status menu for "Add" button (plan to watch, watching etc.).
     - Show a dialog that aks for the wachted episodes when "watching",
       "on-hold" or "dropped" is selected.
   - Disable "Add" button when an anime is selected which is already in the user's list.
 - Code cleanup and doc strings! (first priority)
 - Windows support: AnimeList currently doesn't work on Windows
   (tested on Windows XP), because threads are used. I (Frank)
   only have Linux, so I can't fix this.

 - Manga section: will be done when the Unofficial API has support for manga.
 - Block application when no user details are entered and validated.
 - Save window size on exit.
 - Details dialog for anime.
 - Modularize sections for better extensibility.

Maybe
 - Media player detection.
 - Torrent section.

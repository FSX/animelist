AnimeList is still under development and not everything works yet and stuff can be bugged.
Only tested on Linux (Arch linux), does not work on Windows (XP) (yet) and Mac (OSX) has
not bee tested yet.

To startup AnimeList you need to make a ".animelist" directory in your home directory and
put a file called "preferences.cfg" in it. In that file you put the following text:

[user]
name=yourusername
password=yourpassword

After that you can 'cd' to the AnimeList directory and make "animelist.py" executable
(if needed) and do "./animelist.py".

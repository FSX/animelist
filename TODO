TODO for AnimeList

 - Search section.
 - Code cleanup and doc strings.
 - Windows support: AnimeList currently doesn't work on Windows
   (tested on Windows XP), because threads are used. I (Frank)
   only have Linux, so I can't fix this.

 - Manga section: will be done when the Unofficial API has support for manga.
 - Block application when no user details are entered and validated.
 - Save window size on exit.
 - Details dialog for anime.

Maybe
 - Media player detection.
